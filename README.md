**Shortcutter is an alternative to File Explorer to view files; specifically application shortcuts.**

This software allows the user to customize the window color, size, and target folder of shortcut "Containers" to clean up the desktop.
How to use:

1. Organize your shortcuts by placing them into custom-named folders in C:\Program Shortcuts (or your preferred location).
2. Open the program and select the target folder using the ...\ button.
3. Click the Save arrow button to open a prompt to change the window color.
4. After a color is selected, a the view settings are saved in C:\Program Shortcuts\Saved Views and a Container shortcut is added to the desktop with the selected target folder name.
5. Right-click the Container file on the desktop and select Properties --> Change Icon and use select a custom icon from Windows or any ICO file you have saved.
6. Open the Container to access your shortcuts.

This is a very basic program designed to clean up desktop shortcuts. It takes a bit of setup but the result is worth it. This is the first piece of software I've published, it is very crudely written in Visual Basic. I will gladly consider feature updates or bug fixes if they are brought to my attention.

I generated the custom icons with Favicon:
