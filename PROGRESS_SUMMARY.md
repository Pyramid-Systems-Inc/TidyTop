# TidyTop - Migration Progress Summary

## Current Status

We have successfully started the migration of the legacy Visual Basic .NET desktop organizer application to a modern cross-platform desktop organization tool similar to Fences® 6, using .NET 8 and Avalonia UI.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Development Environment Setup ✅
- Installed .NET 8 SDK
- Set up Avalonia UI templates
- Configured project structure for cross-platform development

### 2. Project Structure Creation ✅
- Created solution file: `TidyTop.sln`
- Set up project structure with proper separation of concerns:
  - `TidyTop.App` - Main application project (Avalonia UI)
  - `TidyTop.Core` - Core business logic and models
  - `TidyTop.Data` - Data access layer
  - `TidyTop.App.Tests` - UI and integration tests
  - `TidyTop.Core.Tests` - Unit tests for core logic
- Configured project references between all projects

### 3. Git Repository Initialization ✅
- Initialized Git repository
- Added proper .gitignore file for .NET projects
- Created README.md with project overview and build instructions

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline Setup ✅
- Created GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml`)
- Configured build and test pipeline for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Set up artifact publishing for all platforms

### 5. Core Data Models ✅
Created comprehensive data models for the desktop organization system:

#### DesktopIcon.cs
- Represents desktop icons with properties like name, path, position, size
- Supports both regular files and shortcuts
- Includes metadata like creation/modification dates and file size

#### Fence.cs
- Represents customizable fence containers for organizing icons
- Supports appearance customization (colors, opacity, borders)
- Includes layout options (grid, horizontal, vertical, freeform)
- Supports sorting rules and icon spacing configuration
- Includes locking and visibility controls

#### DesktopLayout.cs
- Represents complete desktop layouts with all fences and icon positions
- Supports save/restore functionality for desktop arrangements
- Includes desktop resolution information
- Provides cloning functionality for layout variations
- Contains global settings for each layout

#### DesktopSettings.cs
- Global application settings with extensive customization options
- Includes auto-organization rules with priorities
- Supports quick hide functionality with configurable hotkeys
- Includes animation settings and grid snapping options
- Provides theme support (system, light, dark)
- Contains auto-organization rules engine

## Next Steps (When Continuing)

- Implement settings migration from VB.NET format
- Add settings validation and change notifications
- Create settings UI for user customization

### 10. Main File Listing View ⏳
- Transform from simple list view to desktop overlay
- Implement fence container controls
- Add icon display and organization within fences
- Create responsive layout system

### 11. Folder Management Functionality ⏳
- Adapt to fence management functionality
- Create fence creation and editing UI
- Implement fence customization options
- Add layout management features

### 12. Settings and Customization UI ⏳
- Create comprehensive settings dialog

- Add quick hide/show functionality
- Create rules engine for automatic organization

### 13. Advanced Features ⏳
- Implement auto-organization rules
- Add desktop portal functionality
- Create quick hide/show animations
- Add keyboard shortcuts and gestures

### 14. Performance Optimization ⏳
- Optimize desktop icon tracking
- Improve fence rendering performance
- Implement lazy loading for icons
- Add caching strategies for better performance

### 15. Testing Implementation ⏳
- Create unit tests for all services
- Implement integration tests for UI workflows
- Add performance testing
- Create cross-platform compatibility tests

### 16. Deployment Configuration ⏳
- Create installation packages for all platforms
- Set up auto-update mechanism
- Create migration tools for existing users
- Prepare documentation and release notes

## Key Design Decisions Made

1. **Technology Stack**: Chose .NET 8 with Avalonia UI for cross-platform desktop application development
2. **Architecture**: MVVM pattern with clean architecture principles
3. **Project Structure**: Separated concerns into distinct projects (App, Core, Data, Tests)
4. **Data Models**: Created comprehensive models to support Fences-style functionality
5. **CI/CD**: Set up GitHub Actions for automated builds and testing across platforms
